# Logout Button Challenge

This project challenges users to log out by clicking on a moving button that tries to escape the cursor. The button moves away from the cursor whenever it gets too close, making it difficult for users to click on it. The goal is to test user patience and precision.

## Demo

You can see the live demo [here](https://mrranger939.github.io/logout/).

## Features

- **Dynamic Button Movement**: The button moves away from the cursor to evade clicking.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility and functionality across different screen sizes.
- **Alert System**: Provides visual cues (commented out) to guide the user when the button is within clicking range.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Styling and animations)
- JavaScript (Event handling and dynamic movement)
